# AppGameKit for Python Toolkit

The goal of this library is to make using AppGameKit for Python more Pythonic, creating modules and classes to group commands together logically.

This is a work-in-progress and will likely undergo dramatic changes as it is developed.

You will need:
* [AppGameKit for Python](https://fascimania.itch.io/appgamekit-for-python)
